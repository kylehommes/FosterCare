# Foster Care Analysis
An investigation of service and outcomes data for youth transitioning out of foster care using Python.


# Project Overview

Data:

The data for this project came from the Nation Youth in 	Transition Dataset which is part of the National Data  Archive for Child Abuse and Neglect at Cornell University. It consists of survey data from a series of evaluations done with youth transitioning out of the foster care system. The data was mainly categorical in nature and consisted of outcomes data, data on the services with which the youth were involved, and demographic data.

Analysis:

The analysis of the data was done in Python and the visualization of the data was completed using Tableau. The categorical data from the surveys was transformed using a scoring system to aid in the Exploratory Data Analysis and help gain insight into the trends within the data. Then, machine learning was used to predict homelessness based on the services that the youth were involved with and the youth were organized into clusters using K-means clustering.

Outcome:

The visualization dashboard showed various trends within the data including differences in outcomes based on state and level of involvement in the foster care system. The K-means clustering analysis created a large group of the surveyed youth that had outcomes scores below the mean and split the youth with outcomes scores over the mean into several groups. For the machine learning process, Decision Tree algorithm was used, which accomplished an accuracy of 88.36% for the model.
